In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28].

[...] In the Transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism plays a crucial role by helping the model decide how important each word or token is in a sequence. It does this by giving attention scores to words based on how relevant they are to others in the sequence. This way, the model can focus on the most contextually important information.

In other words, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence and dynamically adjust their influence on the output. This is especially important for language processing tasks, where the meaning of a word can change based on its context within a sentence or document. [...] In this section, we are adapting the previously discussed self-attention mechanism into a causal self-attention mechanism, specifically for GPT-like (decoder-style) LLMs that are used to generate text.

This is already a lot of information to take in. Let’s leave the training of a neural network using [...] To overcome this issue, attention mechanisms were introduced to give access to all sequence elements at each time step.
